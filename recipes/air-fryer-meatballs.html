    <h3 class="title">About this recipe</h3>
    <p>Cook these sausage and beef meatballs in an air-fryer for ease. Serve with tomato sauce and pasta or enjoy in a meatball sub.</p>
    <h3 class="title">Ingredients List</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>4 good-quality sausages</li>
        <li>500g beef mince</li>
        <li>1/2 onion</li>
        <li>50g parmesan</li>
        <li>50g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Handful of parsley</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="title">How to make:</h3>
    <ol>  
    <li>Squeeze the sausagemeat out of the skins into a bowl, then tip in the remaining ingredients, plus a good pinch of salt and a few cracks of black pepper. Mix everything well â€“ this is easiest to do with your hands giving everything a good squeeze together. This part is very important as the better combined the ingredients are, the less likely the meatballs are to fall apart during cooking.</li>
    <li>Roll the mixture into 20-25 balls. Transfer to a tray or plate, then chill for 20 mins.</li>
    <li>Heat the air-fryer to 180C. Put the meatballs in the air-fryer basket and cook for 10-12 mins until golden and cooked through. You may need to do this in batches, or cook all of them and move them around halfway through cooking. Serve with tomato sauce and pasta, or sandwiched in a sub.</li>
    </ol>
